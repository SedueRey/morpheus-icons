# Icons for Morpheus Master / Sakai

The new Morpheus skin has new icons on it. This repo will help to maintain source files for those icons. 

## Scripting

While we don't need, by now, vector typographies as long as PNG sprites are smaller than them I have added a PHP script you can run to export the 3 color set sakai is using by now.

```
cd scripts
/path/to/php script.php
```

## Updating

If there's a need of another icon tell me and I'll try to do my best

## Considerations...

Of course, feel free to contribute :)
